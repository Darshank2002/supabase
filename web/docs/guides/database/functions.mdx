Postgres has built-in support for [SQL functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html). 
These functions live inside your database, and they can be [used with the API](/docs/reference/javascript/rpc).

## Preparation

For this guide we'll use the following example data:


<Tabs
defaultValue="Data"
values={[
  {label: 'Data', value: 'Data'},
  {label: 'SQL', value: 'SQL'},
]}>

<TabItem value="SQL">

```sql
create table books (
  id serial primary key,
  title text,
  author text,
  description text
);

insert into books (title, author, description) 
values 
  ('The Poky Little Puppy','Janette Sebring Lowrey','Puppy is slower than other, bigger animals.'),
  ('The Tale of Peter Rabbit','Beatrix Potter','Rabbit eats some vegetables.'),
  ('Tootle','Gertrude Crampton','Little toy train has big dreams.'),
  ('Green Eggs and Ham','Dr. Seuss','Sam has changing food preferences and eats unusally colored food.'),
  ('Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire','J.K. Rowling','Fourth year of school starts, big drama ensues.');
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Data">
